# MY Portfolio Website
I made This Portfolio Website while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I took many hours to code and I am very proud of it! I have recently updated it using JavaScript. You can see that there is now a more
dynamic contact page to click on. There is also now a slide show with my photos. This website has been a great learning curve and I am very happy to have done it. It showed me how real-life websites are created.
I can sure see myself using this website in future job applications. 
# MY One-page website
This was a very fun assignment to work on. I updated my Dog Foundation website to make it more dynamic and eye-catching. The main focus was adding a lightbox to my pictures. This was very
cool to learn about. It also made my photos stand out a lot.
# MY Essay
Writing this essay made me realize how much Javascript is really unique and a great tool for software developers. I definitely appreciate the language more after doing more 
research on the topic.
